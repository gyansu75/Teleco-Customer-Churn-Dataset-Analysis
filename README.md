# [ Teleco-Customer-Churn-Dataset-Analysis]()

This is a project I did for Scriptguru Digital Solutions Pvt. Ltd , where I build a recommendation system for a Telecom Company named TELECO on there Churn Data set.

## 📌 Project Overview
The given dataset is of a Telecom Company named TELECO which consists of data regarding :
- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

## Assumptions
1.Churn rate varies due to the **type of Contract** .
2.Churn rate increases as the Duration of the **Tenure** is longer.
3.Concentration in **variation of the Tenure** is high.

---

    

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Check the Churn Rates for each type of Contract and plot the information in a Bar graph of Analysis
- Check the Variation concentration of Tenure and find out if variation is high or low
- Prepare a graph to compare Churn Rates for Long v/s Short Tenure
- Give Recommendations Based on Analysis

## 📈 Key Findings
![Alt Text](cr_month.png)

1. The Bar graph shows the reservations that are canceled and those that are not. According to the Analysis performed we found out that approx 37 % of clients canceled their reservations,that is a key factor contributing to decline in hotel earnings ,though, the number of bookings were high enough.

2. This shows in comparison to resort hotels, city hotels have more bookings, indicating that resort hotels have higher prices.

3. The Line graph shows that,on certain days,the average daily rate for a city hotel is less than that of resort hotels and on some days it is less. This indicates that weekends and holidays may see price hikes in resort hotels' rates.
