1. The Bar graph shows the reservations that are canceled and those that are not. According to the Analysis performed we found out that approx 37 % of clients canceled their reservations,that is a key factor contributing to decline in hotel earnings ,though, the number of bookings were high enough.

2. This shows in comparison to resort hotels, city hotels have more bookings, indicating that resort hotels have higher prices.
